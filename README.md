Repo for the blog mypizzaisbroken.com

## Intro


Hello everyone, my name is Erik Tank, and I’ve been programming for some time. I started on my Commador 64 writing in Basic, did a long stint writing Perl, and am currently working in Go - with many languages in between.

Why is my pizza broken? The name comes from my nephew’s meltdown at Pizza Port many years ago. As he was wailing about his pizza being broken (a direct quote), I realized this was a perfect metaphor for the state of programming. As coders, we have all the tools, technology, and advantages; however, we still write ‘broken’ code. My idea of ‘broken’ means anything from code errors to tech debt accumulated while getting code into production.

As a senior coder, I want to share what I’ve learned and am currently learning. My goal for this blog is to share lessons and better ways to deliver quality code.

Thank you for stopping by,

Erik
