TL:DR; Issues, on GitHub, is an excellent way to find and to contribute to open source projects. Sorry, but you no longer have an excuse not to learn, grow, or contribute. (https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+language%3AGo+&type=issues)

# What Is GitHub

If you’ve never heard of GitHub, check out [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM) for a 2 minute explanation. For a more in-depth example of using Git you can look at DevOps For Develpers’ [Introduction to Source Control for DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfgsJhMPh4w).

# GitHub Has Issues

GitHub literally has [Issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+language%3AGo+&type=issues)! There’s a joke in there somewhere but we will save it for another time. As the owner of a project, there are always more things to get done than there is time.

Enter “Issues”, an itemized list of flagged items that require further work.

## What GitHub Issues Do for a Project

GitHub has been rolling out more features to help project creators. Issues, the feature we are focusing on here, helps organize requirements, future work, and facilitate collaboration. It allows the project owner to create discrete units of work to move the project along.

Ideally, Issues should have the following:

* Summary - describing what needs to be accomplished and/or how it will impact the project.
* Acceptance Criteria - explicit steps that need to be covered for the Issue to be considered done.
* Notes - any additional information. If it is a bug, the steps to reproduce the bug.

## How GitHub Issues Will Help You Grow

Issues is a great place to recognize projects that have open tasks waiting for a developer. Too often I have been in the middle of writing my code, deep in the matrix, creative juices flowing when I realize something needs refinement.  If I stop to work on that, I loose the momentum and can stall out.  With Issues, I can flag that area of concern and come back to it when I have the time to learn a new skill and build my portfolio. Any flagged item with the tag “good first issue” will give you a place to start. These may often be relatively easy to fix and are a great entry point for open-source contributions.

If you want to learn a new skill, here are some steps to try:

* Set realistic goals. It takes time and effort to become proficient. Easy is relative; completing that first task can take a significant effort.
* Be patient. There will be times when you feel frustrated or discouraged, just remember that everyone makes mistakes when learning something new.
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help. You are here to improve a project; the owners will be happy with your initiative. Having said that, remember patience. This is someone’s passion project, but they probably have a day job too and It may take a day or two to respond.

## Any Commit Is Welcome

You may think your commit is insignificant; do not allow that to stop you. When venturing into the world of open-source software, you will find communities that are happy for all contributions, regardless of size or perceived importance. [Follow this link to see a one character change to a project’s documentation](https://github.com/apache/avro/commit/5f064c0d162ea3bb2a28b576c590638052177054).

__Transition needs to be smoothed out - maybe personal story:__

As with the above example, don’t believe all commits must be code. Documentation updates are always welcome and can be an easy first commit to a project.

## How to Choose a GitHub Issue Wisely

__take a second look at this paragraph:__
If you are still new to coding and think Issues might be a valuable tool, there are many available projects to try.  Finding the right projects for you can sometimes be daunting.  If you’re an old pro the daunting part might be trying something new, like Issues.  Again, pick your project carefully, with an eye toward your own needs

Here are some things to consider while looking for a project to contribute to:

### Chose a Project that Interests You

Let’s be honest; you are less likely to finish a GitHub Issue if you’re not interested in the work. Sometimes, you need to push through the suck to grow and learn; working on a subject that you believe in helps.

### Chose a Project that Wants to Help You Start

Once you have a narrowed list of interesting projects, an excellent place to start is with each project’s README.md file. Take the time to read any files ending in .md, as those files will have more information about different aspects of the project. CONTRIBUTING.md is the usual location for opportunities to contribute.

If you find a project that holds your attention but has no “development” documentation, then you’ve found your first commit. Take a first stab at the documentation and ask the project’s owner for clarification or help if you get stuck. This interaction can help you determine if this is worth your time and effort.  If not, keep looking.

### The GitHub Issue Is Clearly Defined

The Issue should have a clear goal and definition of done. Rarely does an Issue come with section headers, but the issue should have an identifiable Summary, Acceptance Criteria (describes what needs to be done), and Notes that help guide you to accomplish the acceptance criteria.

If any of this information is missing or unclear, ask for clarification. 

Your job is to code, not define the task or decide what success looks like, that is for the creator.  Coding is hard enough, so before you commit to expending a great deal of effort on this task make sure everyone agrees what it is that needs to be done.  That will keep you from blindly coding while the owner changes the parameters with every email.

### Is the Project Active

There is nothing like sweating and bleeding all over your keyboard in a Red Bull fueled haze of coding only to have your emails left unanswered and your pull request ignored.

How do you know if the project is active?

* When was the last commit?
* Are there open pull requests?
* How long have pull requests been open?
* Are there ongoing discussions in any of the GitHub Issues?
* Before starting, comment on the Issue you are taking - do you get a response? How long did it take?

## Once You Completed a GitHub Issue

Having exhausted my own supply of Red Bull, this is beyond the scope of this post,, but it’s an essential next step. I’ll let Will Button, of DevOps for Developers, pick up the slack with [Contribute to Open Source to gain DevOps experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkVpcsh_TfA&t=222s).
